# Overview

Overview of how extensions work in RRPM.

RRPM Extensions as of the latest release are simple.

> **Warning** Although simple, extensions can be very powerful, so do not install or download extensions from unknown sources

Currently extensions can be made that add custom presets to the create command. I have plans to extend this to allow users to create extensions that add custom commands.
